# Hungarian Algorithm Visuallization
## Package Requirement
version (not required to be the same)
```
python>=3.7
numpy>=1.23.1
streamlit>=1.15.0
pandas>=1.4.3
```
install
```
pip install numpy 
pip install pandas
pip install streamlit
```
## How to run
open this project directory in command line
```
streamlit run .\hungarian_test.py
```

## To Do
- compare performance with $n^3$ implementation and $n^4$ implementation
- implement the $n^3$ implementation
- compare the result with scipy's implementation, ensure that the code is bug-free
- add more complex visualization support
